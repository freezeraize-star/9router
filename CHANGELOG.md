# v0.1.11 (2026-09-13)

## Features

- **New provider: UniKey (`getunikey.ai`)** — a wallet-funded relay whose credit
  balance is readable from the API key alone. The catalog is narrowed to the 32
  chat-capable models; video, image and embedding ids the relay also advertises
  are excluded because they reject `/v1/chat/completions`. Usage is billed in
  **credits** (1 credit = 0.01 USD, the relay's own unit) with the daily and
  remaining figures derived from spend, so the dashboard shows a real Remaining
  instead of only a spend total. A `unikeyTotalCredits` override on the
  connection sets the grant when it differs from the default 5000, and
  `unikeyProbeBalance: true` reads the exact figure from the relay instead.
- **Any provider whose registry declares a `validateUrl` can now be tested from
  the dashboard.** "Test connection" was a `switch` with a hand-written case per
  provider, so 41 of 69 API-key providers fell through to `default` and answered
  "Provider test not supported" — including poolside, venice, sambanova,
  featherless, kilo-gateway, bazaarlink, bluesminds, morph, baidu, tencent,
  perplexity-agent, api-airforce and xquik. The fallback probes the declared URL
  with the key, and performs a **second anonymous probe**: six of those endpoints
  serve their model list to anyone, so a 200 alone would have reported a junk key
  as valid. When the anonymous probe also succeeds the connection is marked
  active with a warning saying the key could not be verified, rather than a false
  pass.

## Fixes

- **Cohere answered 405 on every request.** The registry pointed at
  `https://api.cohere.ai/v1/chat/completions`, a path Cohere does not serve — it
  405s with a valid key, an invalid key, and no key at all, so it was never an
  auth or model problem. Because 405 reads as "wrong HTTP method" rather than
  "endpoint gone", it looked like a client bug for as long as nobody compared the
  URL to the docs. The provider now targets the Compatibility API
  (`/compatibility/v1/chat/completions`), which is the OpenAI-shaped surface the
  OpenAI SDK is pointed at, so `DefaultExecutor` needs no translator. `validateUrl`
  deliberately stays on the native host, which still serves a model list. The
  Command A family is now listed — `command-a-plus-05-2026`,
  `command-a-reasoning-08-2025`, `command-a-vision-07-2025`,
  `command-a-translate-08-2025` — alongside the existing Command R rows; all seven
  verified reachable. Note that Cohere's Compatibility API does not support
  `documents`/citations at all; those exist only on `/v2/chat`.
- **Freebuff quota rows lost their price.** `parseQuotaData` carried **two**
  `case "freebuff":` arms in one `switch`. A switch takes the first matching arm,
  so the later arm — the one mapping `price`, `priceNote`, `recurring` and the
  peak flags — was unreachable dead code and every metered row rendered with no
  cost, which is the one column a Freebucks-metered account decides on. The
  duplicate arrived 20 minutes apart on the same day (`9362b044` added a
  label-only arm, `fab7753f` appended a superset instead of replacing it), and
  duplicate switch arms are invisible to both grep-by-count and lint. The earlier
  arm is removed; the later one is a strict superset. Verified against the
  account's live session payload: 10/10 rows now carry a rate.
- **Freebuff: the standing "computed balance" notice is gone.** UniKey's
  explanatory text had been written into the `message` field of a successful
  usage response, so it rendered as a permanent per-connection notice on every
  refresh, on all nine connections, even though the numbers were correct. `message`
  is now reserved for real failures (auth rejected, relay unreachable); the setup
  guidance moved to the provider `notice`, where it shows once on the provider page.
- **Smart skill routing never fired for Kiro.** `injectActiveSkills` runs *after*
  translation, so a Kiro body is `conversationState`-shaped and has no `messages`
  array — `userText()` therefore read zero messages and silently injected nothing.
  `userText()` now also reads `conversationState.currentMessage` and `history`.
  The added tests drive the real translator rather than a hand-made body, because
  the body upstream's own test used is not one our translator produces.
- **`x-skill` header was truncated to its first character.** A header value like
  `watermarks-remover,commit-lint` arrived as `w`, so the per-request override
  silently disabled the wrong set of skills.
- **Streaming usage was lost when the client left at the terminal event.** A
  stream that ended on the final chunk — or was aborted after it — recorded no
  usage at all, so those requests were invisible in usage stats. Usage is now
  finalized on the terminal event and again on `cancel()`, both idempotent.
- **Duplicate `ollama-search` entry removed** from the registry list — it was
  inserted twice (129 entries for 128 unique ids). Consumers key by id, so there
  was no runtime impact; the ordered position is the one kept.

# v0.1.10 (2026-09-12)

## Features

- **Add-on Skills — a new `/dashboard/addons` menu** that injects behavior rules
  into the system prompt of every routed request, without touching the client's
  own prompt. Three skills ship: `human-handwritten` (anti-AI-slop copywriting,
  from `miqdadbadjuber/anti-slop`), `watermarks-remover` (invisible-Unicode and
  C2PA/EXIF stripping, from `guillaumemeier/watermarks-remover`), and
  `commit-lint` (Conventional Commits enforcement, built in). (PR #3 by
  [@bagus02](https://github.com/bagus02).)
- **Per-skill routing mode: off / smart / always** — `always` injects on every
  request, `smart` injects only when one of the skill's keywords appears in the
  recent user turns (word-boundary matched, so `copy` does not fire inside
  `copyright`), `off` never injects.
- **`x-skill` request header** — per-request override of the dashboard setting:
  `off` disables all skills, `on` uses the saved list, or pass a comma-separated
  list of skill ids.
- **Secure skill prompt updater** — pulls a prompt from a whitelisted source
  repo, compares SHA-256 against the local file, writes a `.bak` before
  overwriting, and skips anything edited locally. Source repo/branch/path are
  read from the local manifest only, never from the request; both the POST and
  GET paths run the same validation; `prompt_file` is basename-validated;
  64 KB cap, UTF-8 check, 15 s timeout, 5 min cache, per-skill update lock and
  atomic tmp+rename writes.
- **Freebuff: request pacing is now provider config** (`pacing.gapSeconds`),
  overlappable from the dashboard. A new **Pacing Gap** field on the freebuff
  provider page sets the minimum idle gap between two requests on one account,
  in seconds; empty falls back to the default (20 s). Resolution order is
  dashboard setting → `FREEBUFF_PACING_GAP_MS` → provider config → built-in
  default, and both the executor gate and the keeper read the same value. Applies
  on save, with no restart.
- **Freebuff: Muse Spark 1.3 is the standing model row.** 1.2 was retired from
  upstream's pickers on 2026-09-02; we had kept it after a probe saw 1.3 return
  404, which turned out to be a stale key rather than a withdrawal — upstream
  serves both ids from one shared pool at the same 15 Freebucks/hr. 1.3 now
  carries its own root agent and capability entry, and 1.2 stays selectable with
  a `supersededBy` pointer so sessions already admitted on it still run.

## Fixes

- **Backup silently dropped 8 `apiKeys` columns.** `exportDb` hand-picked 6 of
  the table's 14 columns, so `tokenLimit`, `usedTokens`, `resetInterval`,
  `lastResetAt`, `allowedModels`, `rpmLimit`, `tpmLimit` and `ipWhitelist` never
  reached a backup, and `importDb` wrote back the same 6. Nothing errored: an
  export→import cycle zeroed a key's token usage and erased its rate caps, model
  allowlist and IP whitelist, and you would only notice when a limit stopped
  being enforced. One canonical column list now drives the export shape AND both
  the INSERT and UPDATE SQL, so the column list and its placeholders cannot
  drift apart. Old backups that carry only the 6 legacy fields still import,
  landing on `createApiKey`'s defaults.
- **Freebuff: session claims realigned with the 2026-09 upstream API.** Claiming
  moved to `POST /session/admission` (legacy `POST /session` kept as a fallback
  — cached when admission returns 405, retried once without caching on 404, which
  is ambiguous with "no row yet"), plus a 45 s liveness heartbeat so the server
  keeps our concurrency slot, the four new gate statuses `consent_required` /
  `purchase_claim_released` / `purchase_in_use` / `purchase_capacity`, the
  `x-freebuff-wallet-spend-limit: 0` claim header, and reporting of the
  account-level `freeWindows` day/week/month allowance.
- **Relay labels now name the real relay kind.** All three relay pool types
  (vercel, cloudflare, deno) ride one shared transport field, so logging that
  field's name reported a Cloudflare Worker as `vercel-relay=`. Logs now print
  the pool's actual type, which matters because the wrong label sent readers
  hunting a mis-typed pool that was in fact correct.
- **Long proxy URLs no longer push the endpoint row out of shape.** The URL field
  could not shrink — flex items default to `min-width: auto` — so at 320 px a long
  Vercel relay URL pushed the copy button past the row and made the page scroll
  sideways. `min-w-0` plus `truncate` lets the field shrink and ellipsize.
- **The pacing input clipped its own value.** Measured in a browser: the field's
  content box was 62 px while a 5-digit value needs 69 px, so anything from 99999
  up rendered cut off with no scrollbar or warning. Widened to the narrowest
  width that fits every realistic value.
- **Add-on skill row collapsed on phones.** At 320 px the fixed-width control
  cluster left the text column 23.9 px wide — about one character — and the
  description spilled out of its box. The row now stacks below `sm` (icon and text
  full width, controls on their own line) and is unchanged from `sm` up, so
  desktop is pixel-identical: the text column goes from 23.9 px to 198 px at
  320 px, and stays 599.9 px at 1024 px and above.
- **Groq and Ollama usage reporting.** Groq exposes its rate limits only on a
  chat completion response, not on `/models`, so quota showed as unknown; a
  minimal probe with a TTL cache now reads them. Ollama's monthly bucket is read
  from `limits.monthly.usage` with `session`/`weekly` fallbacks.
- **models.dev limits reach CodeBuddy** — `codebuddy-intl` maps to the canonical
  `openai` entry so context limits come from models.dev when the gateway has no
  row of its own, with the local 400 K fallback only as a failsafe.
- **9Remote and 9English removed from the sidebar.** Both were upstream promo
  links to unrelated products, neither routing anywhere in this gateway. The
  promo modal, its button component, the unused re-export and 43 translation
  literals went with them; i18n keys that merely contain the word "remote"
  (Tailscale tunnel warnings) are untouched.

## Performance

- **Applying a proxy pool to many connections is one request instead of N.**
  The dashboard looped one `PUT /api/providers/[id]` per connection, sequentially:
  500 accounts meant 500 round trips and 500 transactions, tens of seconds of a
  frozen "Applying..." state, and a failure part-way left the batch half-applied
  with no way to tell which half. A new `POST /api/providers/bulk-proxy` does the
  whole batch in ONE transaction — measured on 500 seeded connections, the write
  path went from 95 ms to 9 ms (10.6×) and from 500 HTTP round trips to 1.
  Connections that already hold the requested pool are skipped and reported as
  `unchanged`; ids that no longer exist come back in `missing`; the pool is
  validated up front so a bogus id refuses the batch instead of half-writing it.
  The old per-row path is kept as a fallback for older bundles.

## Internal

- Add-on skills are shipped in the CLI package (`skills/`), and build-home
  artifacts (jwt-secret, machine-id, sqlite db) are stripped from the published
  tarball.
- Test coverage added for the bulk proxy planner and transaction, the apiKeys
  backup round-trip (verified red-then-green: 3 of 5 cases fail on the previous
  code), settings round-trip including the pacing gap, the models.dev alias
  fallback, and the freebuff pacing resolution order.
- The `verify-no-regression.mjs` gate compares test names against a snapshot
  whose paths are baked in; on this checkout it produces `undefined` names, so
  regressions were checked by comparing full unit runs test-by-test instead.
# v0.1.9 (2026-09-11)

## Features
- **Qwen provider (standalone)** — dedicated `qwen` provider with its own registry entry (alias `qwen`, priority 12, `apikey` category), official qwen.ai icon, and Model Studio API-key console link. Kept as a first-class provider rather than merged into `alims-intl`.
- **Video generation: OpenRouter + Vertex AI (Veo)** — `/v1/videos/*` now routes through a provider-adapter layer (`open-sse/handlers/videoProviders/`) so requests can target OpenRouter or Google Cloud (Veo) credentials instead of xAI only; providers without an adapter keep the previous verbatim passthrough. Poll requests resolve their provider from `x-connection-id` or `?provider=`.
- **Codex image models: GPT Image 2.5 family** — add `gpt-image-1.5`, `gpt-image-2`, `gpt-image-2.5`, `gpt-image-2.5-flare` and `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst` with multi-image support, and mirror the 2.5 ids into the OpenAI catalog; tool-backed image models route through the Codex responses surface.
- **Antigravity weekly quota tracking** — weekly Gemini / Claude / GPT quota from `retrieveUserQuotaSummary`, plus free-tier handling (#3892).
- **OpenCode Go model refresh** — add the ids the provider docs now list: chat/completions `glm-5.3`, `kimi-k3`, `deepseek-flash`, `longcat-2.0`, `hy4-preview`, `hy3`; `/messages` `qwen3.8-max`, `qwen3.8-flash`; Responses-only `grok-4.6`, `gpt-5.6-luna`. `deepseek-v4.1-flash` now leads the catalog.
- **CLI model selector: provider grouping + search** — the flat numbered model list is replaced by provider-grouped browsing (combos first, then providers by alias order), full-text search across all models, and manual custom model ID entry.
- **Claude Code: working context-window control** — the "Context window" dropdown now drives the auto-compact window (the old `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` was ignored for any model Claude Code recognizes), plus a 1M-context toggle.
- **CodeBuddy-CN catalog refresh** — `deepseek-v4-flash` replaced with `deepseek-v4.1-flash` to match the server's product-config payload.

## Fixes
- **Antigravity weekly quota — single code path**: merging the fork's quota work with upstream left two parallel implementations in `getAntigravityUsage` (fork 0..100 scale with `force`, upstream 0..1000); the outer assignment silently won and upstream's family-exhausted reconciliation never ran. Now one path (fork semantics, matching the dashboard's `ratioQuota` convention) with the family-exhausted ported onto it.
- **Claude `cache_control` over budget** — when the client had already spent the 4-marker budget, re-anchoring added a 5th marker and the request 400'd non-retryably across every account; the marker is now capped at the budget and bare single-object content turns are wrapped before the mid-conversation-system fold.
- **Claude tool type defaulting** — `defaultClaudeToolType()` stamped `type: "custom"` on every Claude-format request carrying tools, satisfying MiniMax but breaking Anthropic-compatible endpoints that only accept the legacy typeless shape (DeepSeek). Now scoped to gateways declaring `requireClaudeToolType` (#3905).
- **DeepSeek `/anthropic/v1/messages` tools** — keep the built-in `web_search_*` tools while dropping client-defined `custom` tools (MCP / Read / Bash) that the endpoint rejects with `unknown variant "custom"`.
- **Codex tool schemas** — strip `\p{...}` Unicode-property patterns the `/responses` validator rejects (it has no property escapes), which 400'd the whole request identically on every account and cost a full combo failover per turn (#3922). Codex image requests also restore the `Version` header, now single-sourced from `registry codex.transport.cliVersion`.
- **Kiro `REQUEST_BODY_INVALID`** — never send a top-level `systemPrompt` (kiro.dev rejects it with 400); two downstream paths kept writing the field back after the translators stopped emitting it. Requests also route through the current runtime surfaces (#3776).
- **Cline / Airforce response envelope** — unwrap the `{"success":true,"data":…}` wrapper on non-stream chat completions, which both the dashboard model test and the proxy read at top level and reported as "Provider returned no completion choices" (#3644). Adds the live Cline/ClinePass model catalog and refreshes Airforce free models.
- **ClinePass API keys** — stop `workos:`-prefixing ClinePass API keys (correct for Cline OAuth WorkOS JWTs, wrong for opaque `clinepass_*` keys, causing 401 on every request) and add clinepass token refresh.
- **Qoder usage to all clients** — coalesce the empty finish-in-delta frame with the later `choices:[]` usage frame so OpenAI and Claude clients receive `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` / cache-hit tokens (the dashboard already saw them). Inlined images now upload through `/api/v2/image/upload` like qodercli and oversized non-image blocks become stubs.
- **Qoder Responses plumbing reverted** — the merged Qoder work also rewrote shared translator/handler code to attach usage on `response.completed`, changing token accounting for every provider (proxies saw input tokens rise by the 2000-token context buffer); reverted to keep the previous behaviour for non-Qoder providers.
- **Stale connection locks** — clear `modelLock_*`, `backoffLevel`, `rateLimitedUntil` and `errorCode` whenever a connection is explicitly marked active after successful validation or OAuth re-login (#3810, #3830).
- **Fable weekly limit** — parse the limit from `limits[]` instead of fabricating a row (#3847).
- **Antigravity / Gemini contents** — normalize contents and handle intermediate tool responses so multi-turn tool use round-trips correctly.
- **Video / Vertex path safety** — reject job ids and model ids that would escape the request URL path (base64url decoding accepted arbitrary bytes, letting a crafted id splice a traversal while the Bearer token stayed attached).
- **Custom model caps from live catalog** — the "Import from /models" flow now carries each model's context/maxOutput through to the stored custom model and its `/v1/models` metadata instead of keeping only boolean capability flags; limits stay provider-scoped and unknown models publish no invented limits.
- **Dashboard session calling the LLM API** — a logged-in dashboard browser fetch (Model Arena, etc.) reached `/v1/*` with `Authorization: Bearer local` and was rejected as an invalid API key; requests carrying a valid dashboard session are now accepted, for remote/tunnel access too (not just loopback).
- **OAuth callback host on remote setups** — Antigravity/Gemini callbacks revert to loopback (Google's shared client only accepts it) while every other provider keeps public-URL auto-detect; the dashboard session cookie gets a 24h `maxAge`.

# v0.1.8 (2026-09-10)

## Features
- **APInex provider** — new OpenAI-compatible provider (`api.apinex.bond/v1`) with live per-connection model catalog and usage/quota tracking (wallet USD, key spend vs limit, daily tokens with midnight-Pacific reset, plan label).
- **API key allowed models** — restrict a key to a model list with an interactive model selector modal.
- **API key token limit + periodic reset** — per-key token budget with automatic reset every 5h / 7d / 14d / 30d.
- **API key RPM/TPM rate limiting** — per-key requests-per-minute and tokens-per-minute caps, enforced in the request path (429 with distinct error codes).
- **API key IP whitelist** — restrict a key to specific client IPs.
- **API key editing** — edit name, limits, interval and allowed models from the endpoint page.
- **Usage page: Export CSV** — one-click export of usage history.
- **Context Pruning** — optional token-saver mode (off by default) that keeps the system prompt and the most recent N messages (default 20) to shrink long conversations.
- **Semantic Response Caching** — optional cache for exact-duplicate non-streaming requests (3h TTL, off by default; Bun runtime only — fail-open no-op on Node).
- **Combo strategy + Model Arena** — fastest/cheapest combo strategies and a new `/dashboard/arena` model comparison UI.
- **Cline free model lineup** — synced with the official `api.cline.bot` recommended-models feed: free tier (muse-spark-1.3 contributor, deepseek-v4-flash, glm-5.3-flash, solar-pro4, longcat-2.0, laguna-s-2.1:free) plus current recommended paid models.
- **OpenCode free model lineup** — static fallback list synced with live `zen/v1/models`: muse-spark 1.2/1.3 contributor free, mimo-v2.5-free, ling-3.0-flash-fin-free, nemotron-3.5-lightning-free, big-pickle; dead ids (deepseek-v4-flash-free, nemotron-3-ultra-free) excluded.

## Fixes
- **Token Harbor free-tier 429** — parse the rolling 7-day reset timestamp from the error (`"Your next rolling 7-day period starts at …"`) and lock the model until the window rolls over (8-day guard) instead of re-poking every 30 minutes.
- **Cline daily free limit 429** — parse relative retry windows (`"Try again in 19h 46m"`) into an absolute lock until the daily cap resets (26h guard) — no more 2-minute retry churn.
- **OAuth callback URL on remote/VPS** — auto-detect the public URL (settings.publicUrl > tunnel publicUrl > request host > localhost fallback) so callbacks no longer bounce to localhost.
- **DB durability** — immediate synchronous persistence on writes and graceful database close before process exit (sqljs adapter + shutdown hook).
- **localDb shim** — add missing exports used by chat.js.
- **Console log view** — scrolling up to read history no longer gets yanked back down when new log lines arrive (stick state moved to a ref so scroll and log updates can't race); "Latest" button jumps back down.
- **Background token refresh logs** — successful refresh cycles emit one summary line per tick instead of three lines per account.

# v0.1.7 (2026-09-08)

## Features
- **Freebuff: strict model assignment** — gate connections by `assignedModel` when strict mode is on, so a request for model X is served only by the account pinned to X. Toggle + per-connection model dropdown on the Freebuff provider page (built-in + custom LLM models; disabled unless strict is on). Legacy `freebuffModel` field still honored. Great for single-model-per-account setups (e.g. Luna-only) where pacing locks stay scoped to the account that actually serves that model.
- **Freebuff: model catalog refresh** — matches the upstream waiting-room picker (2026-09-05): added `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`, `upstage/solar-pro4`, `meta/muse-spark-1.3-contributor`, `anthropic/claude-fable-5` (limited offer); removed withdrawn `deepseek-v4-pro`, `minimax-m3` (404 on claim). Base3 root-agent mapping updated, incl. `base3-free-fable`.
- **Freebuff: Claude Fable 5 claim gating** — `guardOfferClaim()` GETs `limitedModelOffers` before claiming (per-account, 45s cache), refusing when the wave pool is closed or daily Fable sessions are used up — no long cooldown on a closed pool, and non-Fable models never pay for the offer GET.
- **Freebuff: Freebucks metered usage + pricing** — Freebucks accounts (2026-09-02+) get a `freebucks` usage block (daily pool, wallet, monthly USD, per-model prices in Freebucks/hr). Dashboard now shows per-row price (`15 Freebucks/hr · promo tagline`) and a Freebucks account header (`10/25 Freebucks daily · resets in 4h 12m · wallet · monthly usage left`). Pricing is server-authoritative — `priceChanges` promos (e.g. Solar Pro 4 Labor Day) expire server-side without a client release. Freebucks exhaustion now marks the account unavailable until the daily Pacific reset (26h cap) instead of retrying every 30s.
- **Custom model token limits** — context window + max output are preserved through custom-model discovery, storage, dashboard metadata, `/v1/models` and `/v1/models/info` (OpenAI-style `context_length`, `max_input_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, `max_output_tokens`). Re-adding a model merges caps; limits are provider-scoped (never leak across providers with the same model id); unknown custom models publish no invented limits.

## Fixes
- **Error log provider filter** — filter now matches by canonical id, alias, uiAlias, and display name (case-insensitive): "Freebuff", "fb" and "Token Harbor" all resolve (previously exact-match on the stored id/alias only). New records are stored under the canonical id; legacy alias rows still match.
- **Provider logos (light/dark theme parity)** — DeepSeek TUI uses the official blue whale mark, Kilo Gateway uses the Kilo Code mark, llm7 background cleaned; dark-glyph logos (featherless, venice, vercel, vercel-ai-gateway, openrouter, jcode, tavily, xquik, ollama-search, elevenlabs) auto-invert via CSS only in dark mode.
- **Freebuff executor** — all requests now send the consistent `Bun/1.3.14` user-agent (was mixed with `codebuff-cli/0.0.138` on the offer GET).

# v0.1.6 (2026-09-07)

## Features
- **Nous Portal OAuth** — sign in to Nous Research with the Hermes CLI device flow (no API key needed): browser login, automatic token refresh via `X-Nous-Refresh-Token`, and per-model capability table (vision / pdf / audio / video / reasoning / context window, up to 1.31M) baked from the live gateway catalog. API-key auth still works side by side.
- **Error log: clear all logs** — new trash button in the error-log dashboard plus a `DELETE` endpoint to wipe records at once.
- **Error log: connection names** — error entries now show the connection name next to the account id, so logs are readable without cross-referencing.

## Fixes
- **Kiro**: drop the top-level `systemPrompt` field — `GenerateAssistantResponse` rejects any payload carrying it with `400 REQUEST_BODY_INVALID` (same text still reaches the model via `contentPrefix`). Also route non-us-east-1 accounts to the regional Amazon Q endpoint `https://q.<region>.amazonaws.com/generateAssistantResponse` — `codewhisperer.<region>.amazonaws.com` has no DNS record outside us-east-1 and the default hosts reject region-bound tokens with 403.
- **UI**: model "Test" buttons can now run concurrently on the provider page — testing one model no longer blocks the others.
- **UI**: API key action buttons no longer overlap on mobile (responsive flex layout + wrapping).
- **UI**: error-log action buttons wrap properly on narrow screens; "Clear all logs" button styling refined.
- **Log**: quieter Freebuff pacing-skip messages (less noise in the console).

# v0.1.5 (2026-09-06)

## Fixes
- **Freebuff**: bounded wait now parses ISO-string `retryAfter` from auth.js (`getEarliestModelLockUntil`) — previously the single-account wait never triggered because `"ISO-string" - Date.now()` is `NaN`, so requests still failed fast with 429 instead of waiting out the pacing gap

# v0.1.4 (2026-09-06)

## Fixes
- **Combo**: revert empty-stream model fallback introduced in a helper commit — an empty upstream stream now moves to the next model directly (as before), and the orphan regression test is removed

# v0.1.3 (2026-09-06)

## Features
- **Freebuff**: lower request pacing gap to 20s (closer to a human cadence; tune via `FREEBUFF_PACING_GAP_MS`)
- **Freebuff**: bounded wait for single-account use — when every account is pacing/model-locked and the earliest lock clears within 30s, the request waits instead of failing with 429 (tune via `FREEBUFF_MAX_WAIT_MS`); other providers keep fail-fast behavior

# v0.1.2 (2026-09-06)

## Features
- **Dashboard**: add Error Log page (`/dashboard/error-log`) with SQLite-backed error logging and filtering via `GET /api/usage/error-logs`
- **API**: allow CORS preflight on public LLM API endpoints so browser clients can call `/v1/*` from other origins
- **Providers**: use official Hyperbolic logo from `app.hyperbolic.ai`

## Fixes
- **Combo**: fail over to the next panel when a panel returns an empty stream (keepalive-only or immediate `[DONE]`)
- **Auth**: scope account errors to the model that produced them — withhold unrelated model errors from logs and responses
- **OAuth**: add 10s timeout to Freebuff session/verify requests so they cannot hang forever
- **Error Log UI**: fix double-fetch race on initial load

# v0.1.1 (2026-09-06)

## Fixes
- **Updater**: point version check and update command at the `nggrouter` package (`registry.npmjs.org/nggrouter/latest`, `npm i -g nggrouter@latest --prefer-online`) so the dashboard banner no longer compares against upstream `9router`
- **Dashboard**: pause console-log auto-scroll when the user scrolls up to read history, with a jump-to-latest button

# v0.1.0 (2026-09-06)

## Features
- Publish this fork on npm as **`nggrouter`** (bin aliases: `9router`, `nggrouter`)
- **Providers**: add Freebuff (with ad keeper + pacing + heartbeat), AI Horde, B.AI, Token Harbor, Nous Research, OrcaRouter
- **Dashboard**: bulk "Import from /models" for AI Horde and OpenCode Free
- **Usage**: surface Antigravity weekly quota (Gemini / Claude & GPT weekly) next to per-model quota
- **Providers**: official logos — Fireworks, Cerebras, Freebuff, B.AI, Nous Research, OrcaRouter
- **Freebuff keeper**: background ad auction + impression ack + occasional `ads.clicked`, 35s request pacing per account, PostHog heartbeat

## Fixes
- **Codex**: lock every model in an account on usage-limit (`modelLock___all`) so the router stops cycling exhausted accounts

- **Providers**: add client-side status filter (All / Active / Inactive / No connection) on the Providers dashboard; add max height and scroll for connection list
- **Providers & Models**: streamline tokenrouter model catalog down to 22 flagship/newest models and add missing provider icons; refresh Codebuddy-CN catalog (add hy4-preview/hy3/glm-5.3/kimi-k3-1, drop EOL glm-5.0/glm-4.7)
- **Models**: capability toggles (vision, reasoning) when adding custom models with upsert and live caps refresh
- **CLI tools**: support saving and managing custom API key presets
- **Quota**: add usage and rate-limit tracking for Groq via `x-ratelimit-*` headers
- **i18n**: complete Indonesian translation (1391 keys)

## Fixes
- **Security**: close SSRF guard bypasses in `ssrfGuard.js` (alternate IPv6 encodings, hostname trailing dots, wildcard DNS resolution check, safe redirect handling) (#3714)
- **Model markers**: strip the `[1m]` context marker Claude Code appends to model names (`claude-opus-5[1m]`) preventing model resolution failures (#3690)
- **Claude**: drop `server_tool_use` blocks carrying foreign IDs to avoid Anthropic 400 rejections; never anchor cache breakpoints on `defer_loading` tools (#3567)
- **Antigravity**: strike-break optimistic quota readings that keep 429ing by blocking the connection+model pair for 15m after 3 strikes (#3681); preserve client identity on model catalog requests (#3414)
- **Auth**: protect root `/responses` rewrite requiring API key validation in dashboardGuard
- **Chat & Docker**: return 503 Service Unavailable when all credentials are rate-limited; explicitly bundle `node-machine-id` into standalone Docker runtime image
- **OpenCode**: route Muse Spark models to `/zen/v1/responses` and declare vision support; filter inactive free model
- **Kiro**: preserve inline images as OpenAI-compatible `image_url` parts in OpenAI MITM; remove redundant top-level `systemPrompt` from payload
- **Usage**: read Responses-shape `cached_tokens` in `extractUsageFromResponse` for non-streaming traffic
- **Models**: support single model lookup with provider-prefixed IDs (e.g. `cc/claude-sonnet-5`)
- **Translator**: route Gemini thinking through `reasoning_effort` on OpenAI-compatible wire; convert `prefixItems` and ensure array items in Gemini schema sanitizer
- **UI**: apply persisted theme before first paint to prevent flash on reload; translate combo vision adapter label

# v0.5.59 (2026-08-29)

## Features
- **Search**: new web search providers — Antigravity (Google Search grounding
  on the existing OAuth account pool, citations keyed and merged by URL) and
  Xquik (X search with `x-api-key` auth, cursor pagination, credit-based
  usage), both on `POST /v1/search`. Based on #3437 by @Nautilaceae
- **Search**: ollama-search and zai-search borrow a chat provider's API key
  instead of requiring their own connection, driven by a new
  `credentialFallback` registry field. zai-search later folded into the `glm`
  provider itself so the web search page shows the shared connection
- **Models**: daily background sync of model capabilities from models.dev —
  modalities keyed by model id (majority of sources must declare one),
  context/output limits keyed by provider + model, strictly additive and
  sitting below the hand-written tables. ETag + mtime cache, 60s startup
  delay, `MODEL_CATALOG_SYNC=off` to disable
- **Models**: add GLM-5.3-Flash (1M context, natively multimodal), DeepSeek
  V4 Vision, Grok 4.5/4.6 (500k context); correct glm-4.6v/4.5v video input
  and output limits, backfill glm-4.6v on glm-cn
- **Usage**: show the Zed plan quota on the dashboard — plan, edit
  predictions, hosted model requests and billing-cycle reset; unlimited rows
  render as "N used · Unlimited"
- **Usage**: track GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark quota windows (spark_session /
  spark_weekly) from the Codex usage response (#3431)
- **Antigravity**: quota-aware routing — on 409/429 fetch live quota for the
  exact per-model resetAt and skip only the exhausted account/model pair;
  report the earliest reset when every account is blocked (#3561)
- **Antigravity**: map image `size` to the aspect-ratio model suffix (-WxH);
  add the Gemini 3.7 Flash tiers to MITM defaultModels so they show up in
  the dashboard model-mapping table
- **Dashboard**: bulk import Grok CLI accounts from JSON — paste an array or
  drag-drop multiple .json files, all OAuth connections created in a single
  call, mirroring the codex flow
- **CLI tools**: endpoint presets shared across every tool card through one
  live-resyncing store, instead of per-card localStorage copies that never
  saw each other's saved endpoints
- **Token Saver**: configurable compression timeout (`headroomTimeoutMs`) —
  the fixed 3000 ms made busy machines time out and send inconsistently
  compressed bodies, hurting prompt caching
- **i18n**: pt-BR expanded to 1132 terms

## Fixes
- **Claude Code**: add Claude Fable 5.1 and advertise Claude Code 2.1.258 in
  both the request header and billing identity; use its permanent adaptive-thinking
  mode with `output_config.effort`
- **Stream**: record usage when a client closes on the terminal event — the
  Responses API has no [DONE] sentinel, so codex closed the socket on
  `response.completed` and cancelled the reader before flush() ran its usage
  side effects; the tail now lives in a once-guarded finalizeStream(). Also
  stop logging a disconnect for every completed Responses call
- **Stream**: parse the trailing NDJSON line an Ollama stream leaves behind
  without a closing newline — the final chunk carrying `done_reason` and the
  token counts was dropped
- **Session**: read the Claude Code session id from the
  `x-claude-code-session-id` header — `metadata.user_id` is dropped by
  Responses translation, splitting one conversation across several
  `prompt_cache_key` values and missing the upstream prefix cache
- **Usage**: preserve nested `cached_tokens` — the top-level-only read
  persisted `cached_tokens: 0` for every Responses-format provider (codex,
  grok-cli, …), billing cache hits at the full input rate
- **Usage**: GLM quotas accept CREDIT_LIMIT plans and multi-interval windows
  (5h session / 7d weekly) instead of overwriting a single "session" key
- **Models**: the catalog sync no longer erases its own output — deltas were
  measured against the previous run's writes (the second run cut `providers`
  from 20 entries to 5); one vote per provider in the modality tally, ETag
  restored from file on startup, and the worker thread dropped after the
  bundler rewrote its path into a module-not-found error
- **Executor**: CommandCode returns errors as a `type:"error"` event inside
  an HTTP 200 NDJSON stream — peek the first events before committing, abort
  and return a real 4xx/5xx so combo/account fallback triggers instead of
  streaming the error text as content
- **Search**: scope failure locks on the credential-fallback path — a failing
  search locked `modelLock___all` and took the shared glm key offline for
  chat as well; locks are now attributed to the connection's owner and
  scoped to `websearch:<provider>`
- **Providers**: connection tests get a 15s AbortSignal timeout instead of
  hanging and exhausting the browser socket pool; guard undefined provider
  names on the providers page
- **Antigravity**: sanitize competing-client branding via a config-driven
  rule table (Zed's Claude-agent prompt, opencode → antigravity) — upstream
  answers 429 Quota Exhausted. Applied in the executor so the shared
  openai-to-gemini translator leaves gemini/vertex/zed untouched
- **MiniMax**: preserve images on the sourceFormat-matched OpenAI transport
  — MiniMax-M3 resolved a Claude-shaped body posted to the OpenAI endpoint,
  silently dropping `image_url` blocks (#3418)
- **Claude**: decloak tool names in same-format streaming passthrough —
  OAuth-cloaked names (CLAUDE_TOOL_SUFFIX) leaked to the client and every
  tool call was rejected as unknown
- **Tools**: default a missing `tools[].type` to "custom" on Claude-format
  requests — strict Anthropic-compatible gateways (MiniMax) reject the
  request with 400 otherwise
- **Translator**: zai thinkingFormat sends the top-level `reasoning_effort`
  object GLM-5.2+ requires — every GLM-5.x request ran at the model default
  (max); gated on GLM-5.2+ since older GLM does not read it (#2721)
- **RTK**: system prompt injection matches each target wire format
  (Chat/Responses/Claude/Gemini/Kiro) and is exact-idempotent across retries,
  so distinct prompts sharing a long prefix are no longer collapsed (#3202).
  Also set the diagnostic before the silent null return on Responses
  translation failure so the panel is no longer blank
- **OpenCode**: route muse-spark through /zen/v1/responses (it 500s on
  chat/completions), normalizing the Chat fields the Responses API rejects
  and clamping max/ultra effort to xhigh
- **CLI**: install better-sqlite3 without build tools on Node 22+ (N-API
  13.0.3 ships per-platform prebuilds, `--ignore-scripts` skips the implicit
  node-gyp build); Node < 22 stays on 12.6.2, working installs untouched
- **CLI tools**: send the API key Codex actually reads —
  `[model_providers.9router.http_headers]` instead of auth.json (which left
  every request 401 and clobbered an existing ChatGPT login); subagent model
  moved to `agents.default_subagent_model`
- **OAuth**: refresh Cline tokens with the extension JSON contract
- **Dashboard**: clamp the API key mask length — keys shorter than 8 chars
  threw RangeError and crashed the media-provider detail page
- **UI**: wait for the Material Symbols font itself before revealing icons —
  `document.fonts.ready` resolved before the 4MB woff2 even started loading,
  leaving icons blank until a second load

# v0.5.55 (2026-08-14)

## Features
- **Auth**: native SAML 2.0 SSO alongside OIDC — AuthnRequest generation, ACS
  assertion handling, SP metadata export, admin config test, replay-protected
  via a `saml_state` cookie matched against `InResponseTo`
- **Providers**: add Alibaba Token Plan (`token-plan.ap-southeast-1`) — the
  fourth Alibaba key type, Singapore-only and OpenAI-compatible transport only
- **Providers**: add `glm-5.3` to GLM Coding and GLM (China)
- **Providers**: Kimchi accepts API keys as well as OAuth (dual auth), with a
  working Test Connection for both modes
- **Antigravity**: add Gemini 3.7 Flash and its tiered high/medium/low variants
  (also in the Gemini registry) with pricing and quota tracking
- **TTS**: add Fish Audio — model id travels in an HTTP `model` header, voice
  is a `reference_id` (preset or cloned voice model)
- **OpenCode-Go**: route by request format via declared transports instead of
  forcing every client into `/messages` — Codex/OpenAI clients no longer pay a
  lossy Responses→OpenAI→Claude double translation. Per-model `supportedFormats`
  guard; the bespoke executor is gone (its shared `_lastModel` cache could cross
  auth headers between concurrent requests)
- **Usage**: dedup + cache Claude quota calls (120s TTL keyed by access token,
  in-flight promise dedup, last-good read on soft failure) to stop multiple
  tabs tripping 429; manual refresh (↻) sends `force=1` to bypass the cache

## Fixes
- **Docker**: ship `sql.js` in the image so the pure-JS DB fallback can start —
  file tracing carried the package's JS without `dist/sql-wasm.wasm`, so a
  container with no native driver aborted with ENOENT and never got a database
  (#3248)
- **Usage**: read Gemini `usageMetadata` out of the antigravity `{ response }`
  envelope — every non-streaming antigravity request logged `IN 0 | OUT 0`
  (#3260)
- **Claude**: re-anchor passthrough cache breakpoints — the client's own
  `cache_control` markers point at pre-normalization offsets, so the tail was
  re-cached every request. Last system block and last tool pinned at 1h TTL,
  last assistant turn at 5m, mid-conversation system messages folded into the
  neighbouring user turn instead of hoisted into `body.system`
- **Combos**: detect images from Hermes and attachment payloads (`images[]`,
  `experimental_attachments`, message-level `image_url`/`audio_url`, inline
  `data:` URIs) so the Vision Adapter auto-switch fires for Hermes/Ollama/
  Vercel AI SDK shapes
- **Kiro**: intercept chat via `x-amz-target` — Kiro IDE 1.0.228+ moved
  `GenerateAssistantResponse` to `POST /` + header, bypassing MITM. Also emit
  the now-mandatory initial-response frame and map the `auto` model slot
- **Kiro**: report real output tokens and stop discarding usable turns
- **Qoder**: detect billing blocks at stream start and return a synthetic 403
  so combo/account fallback triggers instead of leaking the error into chat
- **Antigravity**: strip competitive system prompts (Zed IDE's Claude-agent
  prompt) that Antigravity flags with a 429 Quota Exhausted
- **OpenCode**: send the official client fingerprint on free-tier requests so
  the Console stops classifying traffic as unidentified and rate-limiting it;
  session id resolves conversation-stable to preserve prompt caching
- **Responses**: don't close the message on an empty `tool_calls` array — some
  providers attach one to every chunk, and the truthy check ended the message
  on the first content token (#3234)
- **Translator**: preserve `prompt_cache_key` when converting chat to responses
- **Models**: expose snake_case token limits on `/v1/models`
- **Combos**: strip `stream_options` from the Fusion panel fan-out to avoid a
  DeepSeek 400 (#3024); raise the dashboard model-test probe budget to 1024 and
  soft-pass reasoning-only responses (#3010)
- **Headroom**: the toggle reflects the `headroomEnabled` setting even when the
  proxy is down — it previously showed OFF while the engine kept calling
  `/v1/compress`; proxy status stays visible via the status chip
- **Hermes**: add the `api_key` parameter to the model block in YAML config
- **Providers**: add llm7 to provider test support

## Docs
- **i18n**: add Spanish, French, and Brazilian Portuguese README translations

## Security
- **Real IP**: `x-9r-real-ip` and the Host fallback were trusted from
  client-controlled headers whenever `custom-server.js` was not in the request
  path (`npm run start`, `start:bun`), letting a remote caller pose as local to
  skip API key auth and reach `LOCAL_ONLY_PATHS` (`/api/mcp/*`,
  `/api/tunnel/enable`, `/api/auth/reset-password`). The server now stamps a
  per-process `x-9r-peer-token` on every request it sanitizes and only trusts
  `x-9r-real-ip` behind it — falling back to Host in development and failing
  closed in production (GHSA-pjm4-8fpg-f9p6). Also fixes IPv6 loopback
  detection (`::1`, `::ffff:127.0.0.1`) and routes `npm run start` /
  `start:bun` through `custom-server.js`
- **Search**: `resolveBaseUrl()` rejects client-supplied non-public baseUrls
  (SSRF guard on `/v1/search`)
- **Login**: fresh-install remote login with the default password returns 403
  without issuing a JWT
- **Usage**: `/api/usage/request-details` redacts request/response payloads

# v0.5.50 (2026-08-05)

## Features
- **Providers**: add TokenRouter (300+ models via OpenAI-compatible gateway) with
  exact per-model pricing for 110 models and `reasoning_effort` thinking config
- **Providers**: add Self-hosted STT / TTS / Embedding — point 9Router at your own
  OpenAI-compatible speech and embedding servers (whisper.cpp, faster-whisper,
  Kokoro-FastAPI, llama-server, vLLM, Infinity). Unlike the named cloud providers
  these read `baseUrl` per connection, so one provider can front several machines
- **Combos**: default-enable vision/audio capacity adapter (auto-routes to a
  vision/audio-capable model when the target lacks that capability, falling back
  to `oc/mimo-v2.5-free`), wired into chat handler routing
- **Endpoint**: auto-provision a "Default Key" for first-time users so `/v1`
  works without a manual dashboard step
- **Codex**: support GPT-5.6 Max/Ultra reasoning-level overrides (cx/ routes only)
- **Qoder**: support PAT (Personal Access Token) connections end-to-end, alongside
  OAuth device flow
- **CLI tools**: add OpenDesign (manalkaff/opendesign) support
- **Headroom**: report effective payload savings (tool schema/history bytes broken
  out, byte-savings % reflects actual outbound reduction)
- **Ollama**: Cloud quota tracker (session + weekly) + proactive background OAuth
  token refresh scheduler for all providers

## Fixes
- **Providers**: remove Qwen (OAuth flow stopped working reliably)
- **Passthrough**: detect codex-tui/Codex Desktop as native Codex client — they
  were falling through to the translator and losing fields like `reasoning.summary`
- **OAuth**: scope antigravity header fixes to loadCodeAssist/onboardUser only
- **OAuth**: keep `open` external in the build so xAI/Grok token refresh works on
  Windows
- **OAuth**: declare missing `searchParams` in register-session handler (was a
  500 instead of JSON on error)
- **DB**: `ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGS` env var now overrides the UI setting correctly;
  observability defaults to off (opt-in)
- **Translator**: preserve Codex Responses Lite tool use across chat-native
  OpenAI-compatible providers
- **Translator**: don't drop image-only user messages in `prepareClaudeRequest`
- **Translator**: drop JSON Schema keywords Gemini rejects (`uniqueItems`,
  `contains`, `multipleOf`, `unevaluatedProperties`, `unevaluatedItems`,
  `contentSchema`)
- **Claude**: remove global header cache that leaked one client's identity
  headers onto another client/account sharing the server; gate `anthropic-beta`
  by model instead
- **Antigravity**: drop retired Gemini 3.0 quota tiers, show Gemini 3.6 Flash
  usage bars
- **Cloudflare AI**: declare API key authentication (dashboard showed "No
  connections" despite an active key)
- **GitHub Copilot**: hold monthly-exhausted accounts until UTC month reset
  instead of only cooling down 120s
- **CodeBuddy**: dodge Tencent CN content filter, add usage tracking, normalize
  codebuddy-intl messages
- **Usage**: stop losing cached prompt tokens in the forced-SSE→JSON path
- **Grok CLI**: display the public subscription tier from the OAuth token claim
- **Providers**: count apikey connections for Ollama free-tier card; free-tier/
  apikey providers without `authModes` now default to apikey (were treated
  oauth-only)
- **Build**: include static/public assets in standalone output (login page hung
  on 404s when run via PM2)
- **Server**: support IntelliJ IDEA OpenAI-compatible clients over HTTP (h2c
  upgrade handling)
- **Auth**: redirect already-logged-in sessions away from `/login`
- **CLI tools**: enable Apply button for dynamic OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible
  provider connections
- **CLI**: include complete API artifacts in the CLI package
- **TTS**: a bare self-hosted model name is the MODEL, not the voice — `kokoro`
  was parsed as a voice against a default model, 404ing or synthesising with the
  wrong one
- **Embeddings**: self-hosted embeddings no longer fall back to `api.openai.com`
  when a connection has no `baseUrl` — that silently sent the input text and API
  key to OpenAI under a provider named "Self-hosted"
- **Embeddings**: an adapter that rejects a misconfigured connection now returns
  400 with the reason instead of escaping the handler uncaught
- **Embeddings**: bound the upstream fetch with `FETCH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` — an
  endpoint that drops packets never returns headers, so the request previously
  hung indefinitely

## Docs
- **i18n**: fix port typo, add RTK Token Saver feature descriptions

# v0.5.45 (2026-07-30)

- **Jina-reader**: recover after transient errors, use JSON POST API
- **Usage**: record exact embedding tokens
- **Tunnel**: preserve successor cloudflared PID
- **Console-log**: initialize capture at server boot + prevent SSE proxy buffering
- **Dashboard**: count dual-auth, free-tier OAuth and API-key connections correctly
- **Dashboard**: flex quota rows, thin global scrollbars, no hidden-row overflow

# v0.5.2 (2026-06-17)

## Features
- **Combo Fusion strategy** — fans the prompt out to all member models in parallel, then a configurable judge model synthesizes one final answer (quorum-grace, anonymized sources, graceful degradation)
- **Per-combo strategy selector** — pick `fallback` / `round-robin` / `fusion` / `capacity` per combo (replaces the old round-robin toggle), with a judge picker for fusion
- **Capacity auto-switch** — reorders models per request so images/PDFs route to capable models first
- **Kiro headless API-key auth** (`ksk_`) + direct `claude↔kiro` route that avoids the lossy OpenAI two-hop pivot
- **Claude auto-ping** — warms the 5h quota window right after reset so a fresh window starts immediately (per-connection toggle)

## Fixes
- **Claude 429**: stop hammering the OAuth usage endpoint — cache resetAt, throttle quota refresh to 3 min, cool down after a 429 (chat unaffected)
- **Usage logs always empty**: missing `await` on `getAdapter()` in `getRecentLogs` made `/api/usage/logs` & `/api/usage/request-logs` return nothing
- **Executors**: strip params unsupported by the provider/model (drops deprecated `temperature` for claude-opus-4 → Anthropic 400)
- **Translator**: derive deterministic tool_call ids for gemini/antigravity → OpenAI so function call/response pair correctly (fixes tool-pairing 400s)
- **Antigravity**: strip `optional` from tool schemas before sending to Gemini
- **Claude-to-OpenAI**: handle OpenAI-format responses in the non-streaming path (e.g. xiaomi-tokenplan)
- **Usage views**: show edited connection names consistently across Providers & Quota Tracker
- **Security**: hardened reverse-proxy local-access trust
- **Security**: SSRF hardening on web fetch

## Internal
- Large **open-sse / translator refactor** (~40 commits): unified provider/model registry (LiteLLM-style `models[]` + `kind` field, 100 co-located registry files), single-sourced media/OAuth/refresh/token URLs, registry-based dispatch for usage & token-refresh, DRY translator concerns (buildUsage, encodeDataUri, finishReasonMap, chunkBuilder, reasoningDelta…), ESM-safe registry init, large-file splits, dead-code removal, and golden/no-regression test gates
